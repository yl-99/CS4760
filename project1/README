To compile and execute program:
1. cd into prjoect1 folder
2. Execute 'make' on command line to compile the program. Make file located within the folder called "Makefile" 
3. Execute './simplechain -h' for usage of program

Step 1 Observations - All proccesses are adopted by init, making the parent id = 1
Step 2 located within project1/figure3.2.docx
Step 3 Observations- 100% of the process have been adopted by 'init'
Step 4 Observations- With the sleep(10) fucntion implemented there seems to be less ophan process, as the parent did not finish before the child
Step 5 Observations- The child process seems to unknown, as it is being set to 0 the whole time. Processes id's are not incrementing as usual by one from process to process
Step 6 Observations- The child process is still unknown and the parent is unkown. The proccesses are incrementing by randomly. Able to execute 100 processes
Step 7 Observations- No chnage in output. Only a couple of times while executing many runs was the parentId known. Other than that there were many oprphan process as well as unknown child processes
Step 8 Observations- Pid's are not incrementing by 1 instead at random.
